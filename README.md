# Resturant-System
The goal of the project was to manage a restaurant’s 
kitchen and tables by using pointers. Given 2 files 
(dishes and instruction) the program follows the 
input from the instructions file to simulate a real 
restaurant, using the dishes file to manage the 
kitchen’s served dishes.
